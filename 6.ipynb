    "Handling imbalanced datasets in logistic regression, or in any classification model, is crucial as class imbalance can lead to biased models that over-predict the majority class while under-predicting the minority class. Here are some strategies to address this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resampling Techniques\n",
    "Oversampling the Minority Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increase the number of samples from the minority class, for instance, by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples. A common method for synthetic sample generation is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).\n",
    "Undersampling the Majority Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduce the number of samples from the majority class. This can be done randomly or by using more sophisticated methods that try to retain informative examples.\n",
    "2. Modify Class Weights\n",
    "Logistic regression implementations often allow for assigning different weights to classes. By increasing the weight of the minority class, you can make the model more sensitive to it. This doesnâ€™t change the data distribution but alters the learning algorithm to pay more attention to the minority class.\n",
    "3. Change the Decision Threshold\n",
    "Adjusting the decision threshold (the probability above which a sample is classified into the positive class) can help counteract the bias towards the majority class. For example, instead of using a default threshold of 0.5, you might lower it if the minority class is positive.\n",
    "4. Use Ensemble Methods\n",
    "Ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting can be more robust to imbalance. Additionally, using bagging or boosting techniques with logistic regression as a base classifier can also be effective.\n",
    "5. Use Penalized Models\n",
    "Penalized logistic regression models like LASSO or Ridge regression can help in handling imbalances by adding a regularization term to the cost function, which can prevent the model from fitting the majority class too well.\n",
    "6. Collect More Data\n",
    "If possible, collecting more data, especially for the minority class, can help balance the dataset and improve model performance.\n",
    "7. Data Augmentation\n",
    "For certain types of data (like images or text), generating new samples through data augmentation techniques can be an effective way to balance the classes.\n",
    "8. Anomaly Detection Techniques\n",
    "In extreme cases of imbalance, treating the problem as an anomaly (or outlier) detection can be more effective.\n",
    "9. Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "Use evaluation metrics that are suitable for imbalanced datasets, like F1-score, Precision-Recall AUC, Cohen's Kappa, etc., instead of accuracy.\n",
    "10. Domain-Specific Techniques\n",
    "Depending on the domain, there might be specific techniques to handle imbalance. For example, in bioinformatics or fraud detection, specialized methods are often used."

    "Regularization in logistic regression is a technique used to prevent overfitting by imposing a penalty on the size of the coefficients. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means the model is too complex and fits the training data too well, capturing noise as well as signal. Regularization helps to simplify the model, making it better at generalizing to unseen data.\n",

    "Types of Regularization in Logistic Regression:\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression): Adds an absolute value penalty (sum of the absolute values of the coefficients) to the loss function. L1 can lead to sparse models where some coefficients can become zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression): Adds a squared penalty (sum of the square of the coefficients) to the loss function. L2 tends to shrink the coefficients evenly, leading to smaller and more robust coefficients but does not necessarily reduce them to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization: A combination of L1 and L2 regularization. It adds both penalties to the loss function and controls the mix ratio, which helps in balancing between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Regularization Prevents Overfitting:\n",
    "Controls Model Complexity: Regularization techniques penalize the magnitude of the coefficients, which helps to keep them small and reduces model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalizes Large Coefficients: Large coefficients can lead to overfitting as they can amplify small fluctuations in input. Regularization reduces the effect of these coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection with L1: By reducing some coefficients to zero, L1 regularization can eliminate some features entirely, simplifying the model and focusing on the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias-Variance Trade-off: Regularization introduces a small amount of bias into the model but significantly reduces its variance, helping to improve the overall predictive performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improves Generalization: By discouraging complex models, regularization ensures that the model is better at generalizing from the training data to unseen data, improving its predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation in Logistic Regression:\n",
    "In logistic regression, the regularization term is added to the cost function (cross-entropy in logistic regression). When training the model, the goal is to minimize this new cost function. In many machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, you can control the regularization strength using a hyperparameter (like C in scikit-learn, where a smaller value of C specifies stronger regularization)."
